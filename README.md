# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Introduction

I was given a task to create a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. For this task I was given some starter HTML and CSS code to refactor.

## Technology Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- moment.js
- JQuery

## Summary

When the user loads the page for the first time they are presented with a scheduler displaying the standard business hours and blank text input fields. They can then enter their events they would like to schedule for the day. If they would like to save them they can do so by clicking the save button. When saved, the next time they visit the page their saved events will still be displayed.
